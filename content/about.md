Some of the actitvites which keep me occupied:

-   [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com): Enterprise Support Manager
-   [Django Events Foundation North America](https://defna.org): Co-founder & Director
-   [DjangoCon US](https://djangocon.us): Treasurer

The focus of my work is on cloud solutions and operations for Enterprise AWS customers. Along my personal AWS journey, I have picked up some certifications. I blog from time to time as well.
