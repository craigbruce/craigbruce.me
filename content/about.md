Some of the actitvites which keep me occupied:

-   [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com): Senior Technical Account Manager
-   [Django Events Foundation North America](https://defna.org): Co-founder & Tresurer
-   [DjangoCon US](https://djangocon.us): Treasurer

The focus of my work is on cloud computing solutions for early stage drug discovery. I use AWS extentively to achieve this along with Python and Django to build SaaS solutions and have picked up
various certifications along the way. I blog from time to time as well.
