I'm currently the Executive Director, Design Technology at [Treeline Biosciences](https://treelinebiosciences.com/), where I'm responsible for both our core and scientific Information Technology needs. Previously, I've spent time at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), [OpenEye Scientific](https://www.eyesopen.com/) (Now Cadence Molecular Sciences) & [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/). I enjoy volunteer activities as well which led me to cofound [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/) to run DjangoCon US.
