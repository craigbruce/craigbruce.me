![DjangoCon US 2014](/img/dcus2014.png)

I was at my third DjangoCon earlier this month. As with the previous
DjangoCon's it was a lot of fun. For the first time I was speaking,
which was a first for me, at a tech conference, traditionally I've
spoken at science conferences. My talk was entitled *"Top tips for
developing and deploying on AWS"*, granted more to do with AWS than
Django. However, deploying your shiny new site is just as important as
writing it, it's a rather poor website if no one can view it! With the
rise of DevOps there has been a push for developers to deploy as well.
You can read more on [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/), 
an excellent resource maintained by [Matt Makai](http://www.mattmakai.com/).  

Unlike my previous talks this was the first one to be recorded. I'll be
honest I was dreading seeing the recording (as I don't like
seeing/hearing myself on video). However, I was pleasantly surprised and
actually the talk sounded much better that I thought it went! Most
importantly for me it will be useful to improve my presentation
technique and with video evidence I can track my progress (hopefully
anyway).

You can review the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/craigbruce/top-tips-for-developing-and-deploying-on-aws) and videos - I hope you find it useful.
