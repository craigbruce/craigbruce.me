![Comments on Blogs](/img/blog_comments.jpg)

I have switched the comments on this blog to
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/)Â (pronounced "discuss" as their engineers
have corrected me on numerous occasions). I have nothing against the
former Blogger comments or more recent Google+ comments, but Disqus is
leagues ahead as a commenting platform. Plus, it is built on some of my
favorite technologies: Python & Django.
