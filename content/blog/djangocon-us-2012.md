![DjangoCon US 2012](/img/djangoconus2012.png)

I was lucky enough to attend DjangoCon earlier this month. It was a great
experience, I'm still following up on the new tips and tricks I picked
up. 

This was my first purely software focused conference, they are normally
scientific. There are some stark differences. Notably I'm not the only
person tweeting! Thanks to the wonders of [lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com/) and
[slideshare.net](http://slideshare.net/) I was able to leave DC with all
the presentations I attended. Although I took copious notes during the
talks it is handy to double check details. Plus it was dual track so I
missed half the talks, some of which I would of liked to of seen. 

So scientists, why don't you tweet and share your research more? You
have gone to the effort of writing (thus getting approval to disclose
your work) and attending a conference - that is the hard part. Uploading
to slideshare.net and sharing on twitter and/or LinkedIn is the easy
step! By the same token I will follow my own advice too.
