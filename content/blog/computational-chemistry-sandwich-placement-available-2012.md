It is that time of year again when I can announce my group at AstraZeneca has a new position available. We are looking for a Sandwich Student to join us in September 2012. We successfully rebooted our sandwich student program last year. The ideal candidate will currently be in the second year of their chemistry or computer science degree. No experience is required, but a willingness to learn is crucial as you will learn about cheminformatics and computational chemistry.

Unfortunately, I personally will not be involved with this student, apart from the recruitment process for reasons which are subject to another blog post.

If you are interested find out more here: <http://www.ideas.astrazeneca.com/sandwich-and-summer-placements/> and search for reference: TRES DS 12. Closing date for applications is 25th Jan 2012. Good luck!
