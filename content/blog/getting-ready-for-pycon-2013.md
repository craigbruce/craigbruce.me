PyCon US 2013 is nearly upon us. This is my first PyCon and completes
my attendance at both major US Python conferences (after attending
DjangoCon last September). So thanks to my employer for letting me
attend.  
  
I haven't left for Santa Clara yet but I already feel part of the
conference because of several factors:  
  
-   The conference schedule has been made available via
    [Guidebook](http://guidebook.com/) and [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/).
    Guidebook is an excellent medium for keeping track of your schedule
    across tutorials, talks, poster sessions and more. Plus the
    organizers can (and already have) update the information making it
    the goto source of information.  The only gripe I have is I can not
    find a way to sync my schedule between multiple iOS devices.
-   I'll check back with Lanyrd later to collect the slides from
    [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/) for talks I attended and
    importantly those I couldn't.
-   Various events outside the regular talks have been posted on
    [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) (which also features
    Passport integration on iOS now).
-   Of course you can follow everything on Twitter via the
    [\#pycon](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pycon) hashtag and
    [@pycon](https://twitter.com/pycon) feed.

Attending a conference with thousands of attendees feels much more
personal when these tools are available. I may not be able to catch
speakers after their talks (or even attend the talk at all) but I can
tweet them to seek answers and potentially arrange to meet or I can grab
their slides from SlideShare. I would encourage all speakers to share a
contact medium of their preference and post their slides online.  
  
All that is left for me to do now is try and pick my schedule from the
plethora of interesting talks and other sessions running!
