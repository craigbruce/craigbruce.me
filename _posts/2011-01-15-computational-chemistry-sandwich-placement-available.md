I'm delighted to announce we have a 12 month placement available for a
sandwich student. Typically the third year of a four year undergraduate
degree. It has been a while since my department has had a placement
student, but I firmly believe the experience is valuable for both the
student and us. I did a placement during my undergraduate degree and
thoroughly enjoyed it. Seemingly my employer agreed as they later
sponsored my PhD.  
  
The ideal candidate would be a chemist or computer scientist. The only
skill you need to bring is a desire to learn. We don't expect you to
know all about drug discovery or be an amazing programmer. During the
placement you will have to the opportunity to pick up the
skills required to make a meaningful contribution to our department.

15th Feb 2011. Good luck!
