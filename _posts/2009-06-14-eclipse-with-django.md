[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) is popular web framework written
in Python. For Python users it is an obvious choice to deploy web
applications. Once again I return to my favourite IDE to develop with
Django - [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/).

Two plugins are needed to bring Django support to Eclipse. The second
handles the Django template
[language](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/#topics-templates).
Grab the plugins:

1.  [PyDev](http://pydev.sourceforge.net/) (Python)
2.  [Aptana
    Studio](http://aptana.com/studio/download/thanks?platform=plugin&os=false&ev=3.4)
    (Python + Django)

Both plugins are from Aptana, PyDev is a plugin to their IDE.
Thankfully, both work through Eclipse as well.
