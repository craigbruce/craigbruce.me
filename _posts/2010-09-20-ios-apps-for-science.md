I was going to list interesting iPhone/iPad apps months ago, but there
is already an excellent list
available [here](http://www.macinchem.org/mobilescience/) and
I see no point in reinventing the wheel.  
  
If you fancy hunting through the App Store, which isn't that great a
search you'll generally find science apps under Books, Education,
Reference or Utilities.  
  
Now I have slightly more free time I might have a dabble with the iOS
SDK.
