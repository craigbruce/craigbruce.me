![ABQ WordCamp 2013]({{ "/assets/abqwordcamp2013.jpg" | absolute_url }})

[ABQ WordCamp](http://2013.albuquerque.wordcamp.org/) is not the sort of
conference I normally attend (think PyCon, DjangoCon and AWS Re:Invent
are my regular haunts). Apart from being written in PHP the WordPress
community is more diverse as you can develop and use it out of the box,
with Django you need to build your site first before it gets a more CMS
feel.  

We have adopted WordPress for our company blog so it seemed sensible to
meet some WordPress folk. I followed the user/publisher track, even
though I'm more of a developer so it was refreshing to get a more SEO
and social media slant. Some top tips:  
  
-   WordPress handles most of your SEO for you
-   Building your blog is an active role, find like minded
    individuals/communities and get involved (comment on their blogs)
-   Comments are hugely important for an active and engaging blog
-   [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) is the best commenting platform (plus
    it is powered by Django)
-   If traffic spikes for a particular post then repeat/stick with that
    topic
-   Introduce series for these popular topics
-   Be smart on social media, there are numerous WordPress plug-ins to
    make sharing easy
-   Google+ is the single best thing for SEO, even if you don't use it,
    post to it for instant indexing
-   [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) is perhaps the only URL shortener that is
    indexed by Google
-   Getting to page one on Google does require time and money
    (AdWords, potentially) via a trial and error approach, pick
    keywords, evaluate, update then repeat repeat repeat
-   You must have frequent new content (easier said than done) to get
    high search rankings

During the Developer Diversity Panel a common theme in tech popped up,
that of women. Having heard similar talks at PyCon, WordPress is indeed
well ahead of the curve in terms of the number of women present, which
is great to see.

Yesterday I found out that Google are running [DevFest
ABQ](http://www.gdgabq.com/), so maybe I'll be attending more
conferences in ABQ in the future.
