I download lots of iOS apps, mainly out of curiosity. Some I grow to use
others just disappear. One which I use more and more and has got better
and better is [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/). With the tagline
"Remember Everything" you use Evernote via the web, iOS, Android,
BlackBerry etc. You can do simple notes, todo lists, upload files or
images. I started to use it for making notes at conferences. The
Evernote ecosystem has grown and a great feature is the web clipper.
This add-in for your favorite browser clips all or part of a web site
and saves it as an evernote note. Once in evernote it is easy to search
through it via tags; my google searches even checks my evernote account
now (with permission). [Skitch](http://www.evernote.com/skitch/) is a
recent acquisition but makes annotating images dead easy on your
desktop, iPad or Android device (and then saves the results to
Evernote).  
  
It works on a freemium model. You get everything with some restrictions
(60MB upload a month, no offline data on mobile devices). They get you
hooked then you can pay for unlimited access, which I'm giving serious
consideration to. Why not give it a try at your next conference? I hear
[CUP XIII](https://www.eyesopen.com/events/2012/03/cup-13) should be good fun.
