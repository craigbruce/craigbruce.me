![Eclipse Galileo]({{ "/assets/eclipse_is_here.png" | absolute_url }})

Eclipse continues it's annual eclipse release, this year with Galileo. Available
to download from [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).  
  
33 projects have released new updates, so something for everyone. Of
particular note for Mac users, is the option for Cocoa, the successor to
the Carbon API. (Pick when you download).  

I've tried a handful of plugins and they all seem to work fine:

-   Subclipse
-   CDT (new release)
-   PyDev
-   Aptana Studio

You can find numerous reviews on the eclipse
[website](http://www.eclipse.org/galileo/blogathon/reviews.php).
