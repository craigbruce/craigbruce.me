After three years at a AstraZeneca I decided it was time for a change.
So instead of Manchester I opted for Santa Fe, New Mexico. I've been
here for nearly two weeks now and in terms of culture, food and weather
it couldn't be more different to Manchester. Thankfully, I'm loving
every minute of it. In no small part that is thanks to my new employer -
[OpenEye](https://www.eyesopen.com/). I've had a week at work so far and
am immersing myself in the startup like culture that OpenEye has.  
  
I'm speaking at [CUP XIII](https://www.eyesopen.com/events/2012/03/cup-13)Â next
month on some of my work from AstraZeneca entitled, "Keepalive with
OEChem 24x7x365". Given I work for a software company now I expect
(though I won't promise) to actually post more to this blog.
