![Mac OS X Lion]({{ "/assets/osx_lion.png" | absolute_url }})
  
After switching employer I'm no longer tied to Windows Vista & Red Hat.
Truth be told I'm quite happy on Red Hat, Vista less so. Anyway, my new
setup is Mac OS X Lion & Ubuntu. I use Lion on my personal computer so
that is no problem. Although from a developer perspective OS X isn't
Linux like Red Hat, but once you learn the tweaks it does play ball.  

![Ubuntu]({{ "/assets/ubuntu.png" | absolute_url }})
  
As for my new Linux workstation I was encouraged to use Ubuntu. I tried
Ubuntu briefly at University and didn't really see what the fuss was
about. If anything I found it really annoying as everything I wanted
(developer/sysadmin tools) were not installed. However, a new job means
an open mind and I've landed with Ubuntu 11.10. I had heard about Unity
and indeed it is an impressive desktop, which has been a pleasure to
use. Ubuntu 12.04 is out in a matter of weeks and will feature
[HUD](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/939), which again is very
nice, but is nothing new over one of my favorite Mac apps:
[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (Like [QuickSilver](http://qsapp.com/)).  
  
[Mountain Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/) has just
been announced as well. So there will be plenty of activity for my
operating systems this year, just after I've got them both setup the way
I want them!
